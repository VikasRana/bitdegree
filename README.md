# bitdegree
A simple Python script which uses Selenium to enroll you into all the FREE courses available at bitdegree. Courses already enrolled are skipped.

# PREREQUISITES:

Python 3+ (preferred)

Selenium CHROMEDRIVER Binary

An account at bitdegree.org

# INSTRUCTIONS: 

Download chromedriver from http://chromedriver.chromium.org/ and copy-paste its path on line 6 of the script.

Add your account info on lines 8 and 9 of the script before running.

Finally, run the script.

# NOTES:

The script might throw error at the end because it expects a page to have 12 elements/courses listed. But don't worry it will get you all the FREE courses in your account. The courses you've enrolled into can be looked up here https://www.bitdegree.org/user/dashboard under ENROLLED tab.
